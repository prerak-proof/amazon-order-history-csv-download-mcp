MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for downloading Amazon order history as CSV files.
Supports orders, items, shipments, and transactions export across 16 Amazon regional sites.

## Features

- **4 Export Types**: Orders summary, item details, shipment tracking, payment transactions
- **16 Amazon Regions**: US, UK, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and more
- **Browser Automation**: Uses Playwright for reliable data extraction
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Works with Claude, GPT, and other MCP-compatible assistants
- **Flexible Date Ranges**: Export by year, date range, or recent months

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the MCP server globally from npm, then install Chromium for Playwright:

```bash
npm install --global amz-order-history-csv-mcp
npx playwright install chromium
```

You can also run the server without a global installation:

```bash
npx --yes playwright install chromium
npx --yes amz-order-history-csv-mcp
```

Node.js 18 or newer is required.

For source development, clone the repository and build it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcusquinn/amazon-order-history-csv-download-mcp.git
cd amazon-order-history-csv-download-mcp
npm ci
npm run build
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amazon-orders": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "amz-order-history-csv-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Source checkouts can instead use `node` with the absolute path to
`dist/index.js`.

### Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant:

- "Download my Amazon orders from 2024 as CSV"
- "Export all items I purchased on Amazon UK this year"
- "Get shipment tracking for my recent Amazon orders"
- "Export my Amazon payment transactions for tax purposes"
- "What's my Amazon gift card balance?"
- "Show me all my Amazon transactions from last month"

**Note**: Set `fetch_tracking_numbers: true` to visit ship-track pages and extract actual carrier tracking IDs (e.g., "AZ218181365JE") and carrier names. Without this option, only Amazon's internal tracking URLs are captured.

### Transactions (`export_amazon_transactions_csv`)

Payment transaction details for financial reconciliation.

| Column           | Description         |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Transaction Date | Date of charge      |
| Order ID(s)      | Associated order(s) |

## Additional Tools

### Query Tools

| Tool                                | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `get_amazon_orders`                 | Fetch orders with optional items/shipments    |
| `get_amazon_order_details`          | Get full details for a specific order         |
| `get_amazon_transactions`           | Fetch all transactions from transactions page |
| `get_amazon_gift_card_balance`      | Get current balance and history               |
| `get_amazon_gift_card_transactions` | Get detailed gift card activity               |
| `check_amazon_auth_status`          | Check if browser is logged in                 |

### Invoice PDF download (`download_amazon_invoice`)

Downloads an A4 PDF for one authenticated order after confirming that the print
page contains both the requested order ID and invoice-specific content.

```json
{
  "order_id": "123-4567890-1234567",
  "region": "uk",
  "output_path": "/absolute/path/to/invoice.pdf"
}
```

`output_path` is optional and must be absolute when supplied. The default is
`~/Downloads/amazon-{region}-invoice-{order_id}.pdf`; its parent directory is
created when needed. A successful response reports the saved `path` and exact
`bytes`. Authentication redirects, Amazon error pages, mismatched invoice
identity, rendering failures, and write failures return an MCP error without
publishing a partial PDF or replacing a prior file.

### Transactions Page (`get_amazon_transactions`)

Extracts ALL payment transactions from Amazon's dedicated transactions page (`/cpe/yourpayments/transactions`). Much faster than extracting from individual order pages.

```json
{
  "region": "us",
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-12-31"
}
```

### Gift Card Balance (`get_amazon_gift_card_balance`)

Gets your current Amazon gift card balance and recent activity from `/gc/balance`.

```json
{
  "region": "us"
}
```

Returns:

- Current balance
- Recent gift card activity (credits/debits)
- Associated order IDs

### Authentication Check (`check_amazon_auth_status`)

Verify if the browser session is authenticated before running exports.

```json
{
  "region": "uk"
}
```

Returns authentication status, username if logged in, or login URL if not.

## Browser idle timeout

To release Chromium's memory between requests, the server closes its persistent
browser context five minutes after the last tool call finishes. It leaves the MCP
server running and uses the existing browser initialization code to reopen the
same persistent profile on the next browser request.

Set `AMAZON_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` in the MCP server's environment to override
the default `300000` milliseconds; set `0` to disable automatic closing. Accepted
values are integers from `0` through `2147483647`. Active tool calls, including
long-running and overlapping extractions, are never interrupted by the idle timer.
Tool listings do not keep Chromium open. Mouse and keyboard activity in the
browser does not reset the MCP timer; disable it for longer interactive logins.

Browser lifetime regression checks run without Amazon access or Chromium:

```bash
npm run build
node tests/browser-idle.mjs dist/index.js
```

## Timeouts & Large Order Histories

When exporting large order histories (100+ orders), the extraction process can take several minutes. MCP clients typically have timeout limits that may need adjustment.

### Estimated Processing Times

| Orders | Estimated Time |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 10     | ~15 seconds    |
| 50     | ~1.5 minutes   |
| 100    | ~3 minutes     |
| 500    | ~15 minutes    |

### Recommendations

1. **Use `max_orders` parameter** to limit extraction scope
2. **Export by year** rather than entire history
3. **Configure client timeouts** if needed (see below)

### Client Timeout Configuration

For OpenCode/Claude Desktop, the timeout is typically set in the MCP client configuration. If you see `MCP error -32001: Maximum total timeout exceeded`, you may need to:

1. Use smaller batches with `max_orders`
2. Configure your MCP client's `maxTotalTimeout` setting (if available)
3. The server sends progress notifications which can reset timeouts if `resetTimeoutOnProgress` is enabled in your client

### Progress Notifications

The server sends progress notifications during extraction:

- `Order X/Y (order-id) - ETA: ~Xm Xs`

These help track progress and can reset client timeouts if configured.

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For development and debugging, use the official [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) tool instead of running through an AI assistant. This provides:

- **Direct tool invocation** - Call MCP tools directly with custom parameters
- **Real-time response viewing** - See full JSON responses without AI interpretation
- **Faster iteration** - No waiting for AI to process requests
- **Debug visibility** - View raw server output and errors

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Install MCP Inspector globally
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# Run inspector with this server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to:

1. See all available tools listed
2. Click a tool to view its schema
3. Fill in parameters and execute
4. View the raw JSON response

#### Example Test Workflow

1. **Test authentication**: Call `check_amazon_auth_status` with `{"region": "uk"}`
2. **Test order fetch**: Call `get_amazon_orders` with a small date range
3. **Test order details**: Call `get_amazon_order_details` with a known order ID
4. **Test exports**: Call any `export_amazon_*_csv` tool

This is the recommended approach for:

- Debugging extraction issues
- Verifying new features work correctly
- Testing region-specific behavior
- Investigating error responses

## Architecture

This project uses a plugin architecture designed for extensibility:

- **Core Framework**: Shared utilities for CSV, dates, currencies, browser automation
- **Platform Plugins**: Amazon-specific extraction logic (future: eBay, AliExpress, etc.)

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
